Maintain appropriate relationships and constraints between tables, such as foreign keys and unique constraints.



I used Hibernate as the ORM framework to map Java objects to database tables, providing seamless integration between the application and the database.

Developed the project in a modular manner, following best practices to ensure reusability and scalability.
Implemented a user-friendly interface to facilitate user interactions and provide an intuitive experience for managing and exploring recipes.
